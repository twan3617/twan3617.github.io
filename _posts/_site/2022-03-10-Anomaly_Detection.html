<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of being part of the team that submitted our results and working prototypes for the “AI for Decision-Making” (Stage 1 Phase 2) project proposed by the Defence Innovation Network, a University-Defence lead iniative to provide funding for projects with relevance to Australian Defence.</p>

<p>You can find our work, with demonstrations, at https://github.com/sjmluo/Contextually_Situated_Anomaly_Detection. There is also going to be a blog post, which is to be hosted at sjmluo.github.io/anomaly/.</p>

<p>In the future, I will write up my learnings from this project and on anomaly detection as a whole, to both remember and showcase the work we had done and how it might be applied and extended. Stay tuned!</p>
