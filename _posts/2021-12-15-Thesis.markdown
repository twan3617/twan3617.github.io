Whenever one is asked about their background and their studies, one always has to keep in mind their audience to decide how much to _really_ say. As much fun as it might be spouting off all kinds of technicalities and making _absolutely sure_ they won't ask you about what you do again, it's also important to be aware that not everyone has the necessary background, training, pre-requisites, or even just interest (just asking to be polite, man!) This is certainly not a bad thing - after all, our world can only be so delightfully varied because different people specialise in different things. It just makes things so much more interesting when one actually meets someone in the same field, and can go beyond superficialities. Like realising that one person shares one of your main hobbies, and suddenly they're "in the know" in this secret world of yours (any tennis or bouldering fans around? Nadal is my top man, and I can climb pinks on a good day - sounds like absolute gibberish if you're into none of these things!). 

Nowadays, since I'm doing my Masters and focusing on statistics, it's not too difficult to sprinkle some common lexicon words (data, statistics, machine learning, coding)...


The rest is under construction! Check back later :)
