As much fun as it might be spouting off all kinds of technicalities and making absolutely sure they won’t ask you about what you do again, it’s also important to be aware that not everyone has the necessary background, training, pre-requisites, or even just interest (just asking to be polite, man!) This is certainly not a bad thing - after all, our world can only be so delightfully varied because different people specialise in different things. It just makes things so much more interesting when one actually meets someone in the same field, and can go beyond superficialities.

Nadal is my top man, and I can climb pinks on a good day - sounds like absolute gibberish if you’re into none of these things!)." />

<p>Nowadays, since I’m doing my Masters and focusing on statistics, it’s not too difficult to sprinkle some common lexicon words (data, statistics, machine learning, coding)…</p>

<p>The rest is under construction! Check back later :)</p>

        <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. I am hoping to post content related to mathematics and statistics here during my studies and beyond.  Hosted on Github Pages using Jekyll. Mathematical equations are displayed with MathJax.</p>
