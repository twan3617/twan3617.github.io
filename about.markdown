Hi! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Tony, and I am currently a Masters of Mathematics student at the University of New South Wales, focusing on learning statistics and machine learning. Previously, I was a student at the University of Sydney, graduating in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science (Advanced) (Honours in Pure Mathematics), where I wrote a thesis on finding solutions to a particular class of elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) with Associate Professor Florica Cirstea.

On this website, I am hoping to share some mathematical/statistical knowledge with blog posts explaining theory and applications. I will be aiming my writing at the undergraduate level, assuming basic calculus, linear algebra and probability theory knowledge. As time goes on, topics may change, but this is my current plan!
