<p>In this post, we give short proofs for the Borel-Cantelli lemma, which succinctly states that events which reoccur infinitely often in a sequence of events must have probability zero and one of its consequences: unlikely events under one probability measure is unlikely in any probability measure that “dominates” it. We make all of these concepts precise.</p>

<p><em>Notation</em>: We work in an arbitrary measure space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) with \(\{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) a sequence of measurable sets. While we interpret the measure \(P\) as a probability measure and measurable sets as “events” in the outcome space \(\Omega\), there is no explicit requirement that \(P(\Omega) = 1\) for the theory to work. The expectation \(\mathbb{E}\) refers to the integral operator</p>

\[\mathbb{E}[f] = \int_\Omega f \: dx.\]

<p><em>Definition 1</em>: 
The limit superior of a sequence of measurable sets \(\{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) is the set</p>

\[\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n := \cap_{n=1}^\infty \cup_{k \geq n} A_k.\]

<p>Intuitively speaking, the limit superior contains the set of events \(A_n\) which occur infinitely often - indeed, any events which occur finitely often can only be contained within a finite number of the unions \(\cup_{k \geq n} A_k\), and hence cannot be in the intersection of all of those unions. Going off of this intuition, probability theorists may also write this as \(A_n \text{i.o}\), standing for \(A_n\) infinitely often.</p>

<p><em>Definition 2</em>:
A measure \(P\) is said to dominate a measure \(Q\) (written \(P &gt;&gt; Q\)) if</p>

\[P(A) = 0 \implies Q(A) = 0.\]

<p><em>Lemma 1 (Borel-Cantelli Lemma)</em>: 
SUppose \(\sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E}[A_n] &lt; \infty\). Then</p>

\[P(\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n) := P(\cap_{n=1}^\infty \cup_{k \geq n}A_k) = 0.\]

<p><em>Proof</em>: Note that \(\cup_{k \geq n}A_k\) is a decreasing sequence of sets in \(n\), with \(\cup_{k \geq n} A_k \supset \cup_{k \geq m} A)k\) if \(n \geq m\). Hence, by the continuity of measures, we can pull out the limit:</p>

\[P(\cap_{n=1}^\infty \cup_{k \geq n} A_k) = \lim_{n \to \infty} P(\cup_{k \geq n} A_k).\]

<p>Now, each for each \(n\), we have</p>

\[P(\cup_{k \geq n} A_k) \leq \sum_{k=n}^\infty P(A_k)\]

<p>by the sub-additivity property of measures. Since the total sum \(\sum_{k=1}^\infty P(A_k)\) is assumed to be finite, the tail sums \(\sum_{k = n}^\infty P(A_k)\) must converge to zero as \(n \to \infty\). We conclude that</p>

\[P(\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n) = 0,\]

<p>as we wanted.</p>

<p><em>Corollary 1 (Unlikely Events are Equally Unlikely in Dominated Measures)</em>:</p>

<p>Suppose \(Q\) is another measure on \(\mathcal{F}\) and \(P\) dominates \(Q\) (i.e., \(P &gt;&gt; Q\)). Then for all \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\), there exists \(\delta &gt; 0\) such that</p>

\[P(A) &lt; \delta \implies Q(A) &lt; \varepsilon.\]

<p>We interpret this condition probabilistically as follows: unlikely events under \(P\) forces those same events to be unlikely under any dominated measure \(Q\). This makes sense, but how would we prove this?</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: We begin by contradiciton. Suppose there exists some \(\varepsilon_0 &gt; 0\) such that for all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), we have a sequence of measurable sets \(A_k\) with</p>

\[P(A_k) &lt; 2^{-k} \quad \text{but} \quad Q(A_k) \geq \varepsilon_0 &gt; 0.\]

<p>Define \(A := \limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n = \cap_{n=1}^\infty \cup_{k \geq n} A_k\). Then</p>

<p>\(Q(A) = Q(\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n) \\
= \lim_{n \to \infty} Q(\cup_{k \geq n}A_k) \quad \text{Continuity of\)Q\(,}\\
\geq Q(A_n) \quad \text{for all } n \in \mathbb{N}, \\
\geq \varepsilon_0 &gt; 0,\)</p>

<p>but</p>

\[P(A) = 0\]

<p>by the Borel-Cantelli lemma, since</p>

\[\sum_{k=1}^\infty P(A_k) &lt; \sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k} &lt; 1 &lt; \infty.\]

<p>This contradicts the fact that \(P &gt;&gt; Q\), since we have a set of measure zero under \(P\) that does not have measure zero under \(Q\). This completes the proof.</p>

<p>That’s all for today’s post!</p>
